# ### Overview
# In particular, in this assignment you will: 
# 
# - Learn about Siamese networks
# - Understand how the triplet loss works
# - Understand how to evaluate accuracy
# - Use cosine similarity between the model's outputted vectors
# - Use the data generator to get batches of questions
# - Predict using your own model
# 
# 
# Before getting started take some time to read the following tips: 
# 
# #### TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRADING OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
# 
# - All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions.
# 
# - You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.
# 
# - You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!
# 
# - To submit your notebook, save it and then click on the blue submit button at the beginning of the page.
# 
# By now, you should be familiar with Tensorflow and know how to make use of it to define your model. We will start this homework by asking you to create a vocabulary in a similar way as you did in the previous assignments. After this, you will build a classifier that will allow you to identify whether two questions are the same or not. 
# 
# <img src = "./img/meme.png" style="width:550px;height:300px;"/>
# 
# 
# Your model will take in the two questions, which will be transformed into tensors, each tensor will then go through embeddings, and after that an LSTM. Finally you will compare the outputs of the two subnetworks using cosine similarity. 
# 
# Before taking a deep dive into the model, you will start by importing the data set, and exploring it a bit.
#

# # Part 1: Importing the Data
# <a name='1.1'></a>
# ### 1.1 Loading in the data
# 
# You will be using the 'Quora question answer' dataset to build a model that can identify similar questions. This is a useful task because you don't want to have several versions of the same question posted. Several times when teaching I end up responding to similar questions on piazza, or on other community forums. This data set has already been labeled for you. Run the cell below to import some of the packages you will be using. 

# In[1]:


import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'

import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import random as rnd
import tensorflow as tf

# Set random seeds
rnd.seed(34)


# In[2]:


import w3_unittest


# You will now load the data set. We have done some preprocessing for you. If you have taken the deeplearning specialization, this is a slightly different training method than the one you have seen there. If you have not, then don't worry about it, we will explain everything. 

# In[3]:


data = pd.read_csv("questions.csv")
N = len(data)
print('Number of question pairs: ', N)
data.head()


# First, you will need to split the data into a training and test set. The test set will be used later to evaluate your model.

# In[4]:


N_train = 300000
N_test = 10240
data_train = data[:N_train]
data_test = data[N_train:N_train + N_test]
print("Train set:", len(data_train), "Test set:", len(data_test))
del (data)  # remove to free memory


# As explained in the lectures, you will select only the question pairs that are duplicate to train the model. <br>
# You need to build two sets of questions as input for the Siamese network, assuming that question $q1_i$ (question $i$ in the first set) is a duplicate of $q2_i$ (question $i$ in the second set), but all other questions in the second set are not duplicates of $q1_i$.  
# The test set uses the original pairs of questions and the status describing if the questions are duplicates.
# 
# The following cells are in charge of selecting only duplicate questions from the training set, which will give you a smaller dataset. First find the indexes with duplicate questions.
# 
# You will start by identifying the indexes in the training set which correspond to duplicate questions. For this you will define a boolean variable `td_index`, which has value `True` if the index corresponds to duplicate questions and `False` otherwise.

# In[5]:


td_index = data_train['is_duplicate'] == 1
td_index = [i for i, x in enumerate(td_index) if x]
print('Number of duplicate questions: ', len(td_index))
print('Indexes of first ten duplicate questions:', td_index[:10])


# You will first need to split the data into a training and test set. The test set will be used later to evaluate your model.

# In[6]:


print(data_train['question1'][5])
print(data_train['question2'][5])
print('is_duplicate: ', data_train['is_duplicate'][5])


# Next, keep only the rows in the original training set that correspond to the rows where `td_index` is `True`

# In[7]:


Q1_train = np.array(data_train['question1'][td_index])
Q2_train = np.array(data_train['question2'][td_index])

Q1_test = np.array(data_test['question1'])
Q2_test = np.array(data_test['question2'])
y_test  = np.array(data_test['is_duplicate'])


# <br>Let's print to see what your data looks like.

# In[8]:


print('TRAINING QUESTIONS:\n')
print('Question 1: ', Q1_train[0])
print('Question 2: ', Q2_train[0], '\n')
print('Question 1: ', Q1_train[5])
print('Question 2: ', Q2_train[5], '\n')

print('TESTING QUESTIONS:\n')
print('Question 1: ', Q1_test[0])
print('Question 2: ', Q2_test[0], '\n')
print('is_duplicate =', y_test[0], '\n')


# Finally, split your training set into training/validation sets so that you can use them at training time.

# In[9]:


# Splitting the data
cut_off = int(len(Q1_train) * 0.8)
train_Q1, train_Q2 = Q1_train[:cut_off], Q2_train[:cut_off]
val_Q1, val_Q2 = Q1_train[cut_off:], Q2_train[cut_off:]
print('Number of duplicate questions: ', len(Q1_train))
print("The length of the training set is:  ", len(train_Q1))
print("The length of the validation set is: ", len(val_Q1))


# <a name='1.2'></a>
# ### 1.2 Learning question encoding
# 
# The next step is to learn how to encode each of the questions as a list of numbers (integers). You will be learning how to encode each word of the selected duplicate pairs with an index. 
# 
# You will start by learning a word dictionary, or vocabulary, containing all the words in your training dataset, which you will use to encode each word of the selected duplicate pairs with an index. 
# 
# For this task you will be using the [`TextVectorization`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/TextVectorization) layer from Keras. which will take care of everything for you. Begin by setting a seed, so we all get the same encoding.

# In[10]:


tf.random.set_seed(0)
text_vectorization = tf.keras.layers.TextVectorization(output_mode='int',split='whitespace', standardize='strip_punctuation')
text_vectorization.adapt(np.concatenate((Q1_train,Q2_train)))


# As you can see, it is set to split text on whitespaces and it's stripping the punctuation from text. You can check how big your vocabulary is.

# In[11]:


print(f'Vocabulary size: {text_vectorization.vocabulary_size()}')


# You can also call `text_vectorization` to see what the encoding looks like for the first questions of the training and test datasets

# In[12]:


print('first question in the train set:\n')
print(Q1_train[0], '\n') 
print('encoded version:')
print(text_vectorization(Q1_train[0]),'\n')

print('first question in the test set:\n')
print(Q1_test[0], '\n')
print('encoded version:')
print(text_vectorization(Q1_test[0]) )


# Expected output:
# ```
# first question in the train set:
# 
# Astrology: I am a Capricorn Sun Cap moon and cap rising...what does that say about me? 
# 
# encoded version:
# tf.Tensor(
# [ 6984     6   178    10  8988  2442 35393   761    13  6636 28205    31
#     28   483    45    98], shape=(16,), dtype=int64) 
# 
# first question in the test set:
# 
# How do I prepare for interviews for cse? 
# 
# encoded version:
# tf.Tensor([    4     8     6   160    17  2079    17 11775], shape=(8,), dtype=int64)

# # Part 2: Defining the Siamese model
# 
# <a name='2.1'></a>
# 
# ### 2.1 Understanding the Siamese Network 
# A Siamese network is a neural network which uses the same weights while working in tandem on two different input vectors to compute comparable output vectors. The Siamese network you are about to implement looks something like this:
# 
# <img src = "./img/Siamese.png" style="width:790px;height:300px;"/>
# 
# You get the question, get it vectorized and embedded, run it through an LSTM layer, normalize $v_1$ and $v_2$, and finally get the corresponding cosine similarity for each pair of questions. Because of the implementation of the loss function you will see in the next section, you are not going to have the cosine similarity as output of your Siamese network, but rather $v_1$ and $v_2$. You will add the cosine distance step once you reach the classification step. 
# 
# To train the model, you will use the triplet loss (explained below). This loss makes use of a baseline (anchor) input that is compared to a positive (truthy) input and a negative (falsy) input. The (cosine) distance from the baseline input to the positive input is minimized, and the distance from the baseline input to the negative  input is maximized. Mathematically, you are trying to maximize the following.
# 
# $$\mathcal{L}(A, P, N)=\max \left(\|\mathrm{f}(A)-\mathrm{f}(P)\|^{2}-\|\mathrm{f}(A)-\mathrm{f}(N)\|^{2}+\alpha, 0\right),$$
# 
# where $A$ is the anchor input, for example $q1_1$, $P$ is the duplicate input, for example, $q2_1$, and $N$ is the negative input (the non duplicate question), for example $q2_2$.<br>
# $\alpha$ is a margin; you can think about it as a safety net, or by how much you want to push the duplicates from the non duplicates. This is the essence of the triplet loss. However, as you will see in the next section, you will be using a pretty smart trick to improve your training, known as hard negative mining. 
# <br>

# ### Exercise 01
# 
# **Instructions:** Implement the `Siamese` function below. You should be using all the functions explained below. 
# 
# To implement this model, you will be using `TensorFlow`. Concretely, you will be using the following functions.
# 
# 
# - [`tf.keras.models.Sequential`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential): groups a linear stack of layers into a tf.keras.Model.
#     - You can pass in the layers as arguments to `Sequential`, separated by commas, or simply instantiate the `Sequential`model and use the `add` method to add layers.
#     - For example: `Sequential(Embeddings(...), AveragePooling1D(...), Dense(...), Softmax(...))` or 
#     
#     `model = Sequential()
#      model.add(Embeddings(...))
#      model.add(AveragePooling1D(...))
#      model.add(Dense(...))
#      model.add(Softmax(...))`
# 
# -  [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding) : Maps positive integers into vectors of fixed size. It will have shape (vocabulary length X dimension of output vectors). The dimension of output vectors (called `d_feature`in the model) is the number of elements in the word embedding. 
#     - `Embedding(input_dim, output_dim)`.
#     - `input_dim` is the number of unique words in the given vocabulary.
#     - `output_dim` is the number of elements in the word embedding (some choices for a word embedding size range from 150 to 300, for example).
#     
# 
# 
# -  [`tf.keras.layers.LSTM`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM) : The LSTM layer. The number of units should be specified and should match the number of elements in the word embedding. 
#     - `LSTM(units)` Builds an LSTM layer of n_units.
#     
#     
#     
# - [`tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/GlobalAveragePooling1D) : Computes global average pooling, which essentially takes the mean across a desired axis. GlobalAveragePooling1D uses one tensor axis to form groups of values and replaces each group with the mean value of that group. 
#     - `GlobalAveragePooling1D()` takes the mean.
# 
# 
# 
# - [`tf.keras.layers.Lambda`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn): Layer with no weights that applies the function f, which should be specified using a lambda syntax. You will use this layer to apply normalization with the function
#     - `tfmath.l2_normalize(x)`
# 
# 
# 
# - [`tf.keras.layers.Input`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Input): it is used to instantiate a Keras tensor. Remember to set correctly the dimension and type of the input, which are batches of questions. For this, keep in mind that each question is a single string. 
#     - `Input(input_shape,dtype=None,...)`
#     - `input_shape`: Shape tuple (not including the batch axis)
#     - `dtype`: (optional) data type of the input
# 
# 
# 
# - [`tf.keras.layers.Concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Concatenate): Layer that concatenates a list of inputs. This layer will concatenate the normalized outputs of each LSTM into a single output for the model. 
#     - `Concatenate()`

# ### 2.2 Hard Negative Mining
# 
# 
# You will now implement the `TripletLoss` with hard negative mining.<br>
# As explained in the lecture, you will be using all the questions from each batch to compute this loss. Positive examples are questions $q1_i$, and $q2_i$, while all the other combinations $q1_i$, $q2_j$ ($i\neq j$), are considered negative examples. The loss will be composed of two terms. One term utilizes the mean of all the non duplicates, the second utilizes the *closest negative*. Our loss expression is then:
#  
# \begin{align}
#  \mathcal{Loss_1(A,P,N)} &=\max \left( -cos(A,P)  + mean_{neg} +\alpha, 0\right) \\
#  \mathcal{Loss_2(A,P,N)} &=\max \left( -cos(A,P)  + closest_{neg} +\alpha, 0\right) \\
# \mathcal{Loss(A,P,N)} &= mean(Loss_1 + Loss_2) \\
# \end{align}

# ### Exercise 02
# 
# **Instructions (Brief):** Here is a list of things you should do: <br>
# 
# - As this will be run inside Tensorflow, use all operation supplied by `tf.math` or `tf.linalg`, instead of `numpy` functions. You will also need to explicitly use `tf.shape` to get the batch size from the inputs. This is to make it compatible with the Tensor inputs it will receive when doing actual training and testing. 
# - Use [`tf.linalg.matmul`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/linalg/matmul) to calculate the similarity matrix $v_2v_1^T$ of dimension `batch_size` x `batch_size`. 
# - Take the score of the duplicates on the diagonal with [`tf.linalg.diag_part`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/linalg/diag_part). 
# - Use the `TensorFlow` functions [`tf.eye`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/eye) and [`tf.math.reduce_max`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/reduce_max) for the identity matrix and the maximum respectively.

# 
# We'll describe the algorithm using a detailed example. Below, $V_1$, $V_2$ are the output of the normalization blocks in our model. Here you will use a `batch_size` of 4 and a `d_model of 3`. As explained in lecture, the input questions, Q1, Q2 are arranged so that corresponding inputs are duplicates while non-corresponding entries are not. The outputs will have the same pattern.
# 
# <img src = "./img/tripletLossexample.png" style="width:817px;"/>
# 
# This testcase arranges the outputs, $V_1$,$V_2$, to highlight different scenarios. Here, the first two outputs $V_1[0]$, $V_2[0]$ match exactly, so the model is generating the same vector for Q1[0] and Q2[0] inputs. The second pair of outputs, circled in orange, differ greatly on one of the values, so the transformation is not quite the same for these questions. Next, you have examples $V_1[3]$ and $V_2[3]$, which match almost exactly. Finally, $V_1[4]$ and $V_2[4]$, circled in purple, are set to be exactly opposite, being 180 degrees from each other. 
# 
# The first step is to compute the cosine similarity matrix or `score` in the code. As explained in the lectures, this is $$V_2 V_1^T.$$This is generated with `tf.linalg.matmul`. Since matrix multiplication is not commutative, the order in which you pass the arguments is important. If you want columns to represent different questions in Q1 and rows to represent different questions in Q2, as seen in the video, then you need to compute $V_2 V_1^T$. 
# 
# <img src = "./img/tripletLoss2.png" style="width:900px;"/>
# 
# The clever arrangement of inputs creates the data needed for positive *and* negative examples without having to run all pair-wise combinations. Because Q1[n] is a duplicate of only Q2[n], other combinations are explicitly created negative examples or *Hard Negative* examples. The matrix multiplication efficiently produces the cosine similarity of all positive/negative combinations as shown above on the left side of the diagram. 'Positive' are the results of duplicate examples (cells shaded in green) and 'negative' are the results of explicitly created negative examples (cells shaded in blue). The results for our test case are as expected, $V_1[0]\cdot V_2[0]$ and $V_1[3]\cdot V_2[3]$ match producing '1', and '0.99' respectively, while the other 'positive' cases don't match quite right. Note also that the $V_2[2]$ example was set to match $V_1[3]$, producing a not so good match at `score[2,2]` and an undesired 'negative' case of a '1', shown in grey. 
# 
# With the similarity matrix (`score`) you can begin to implement the loss equations. First, you can extract $cos(A,P)$ by utilizing `tf.linalg.diag_part`. The goal is to grab all the green entries in the diagram above. This is `positive` in the code.
# 
# Next, you will create the *closest_negative*. This is the nonduplicate entry in $V_2$ that is closest to (has largest cosine similarity) to an entry in $V_1$, but still has smaller cosine similarity than the positive example. For example, consider row 2 in the score matrix. This row has the cosine similarity between $V_2[2]$ and all four vectors in $V_1$. In this case, the largest value in the off-diagonal is`score[2,3]`$=V_2[3]\cdot V1[2]$, which has a score of 1. However, since 1 is grater than the similarity for the positive example, this is *not* the *closest_negative*. For this particular row, the *closes_negative* will have to be `score[2,1]=0.36`. This is the maximum value of the 'negative' entries, which are smaller than the 'positive' example.
# 
# To implement this, you need to pick the maximum entry on a row of `score`, ignoring the 'positive'/green entries, and 'negative/blue entry greater that the 'positive' one. To avoid selecting these entries, you can make them larger negative numbers. For this, you can create a mask to identify these two scenarios, multiply it by 2.0 and subtract it out of `scores`. To create the mask, you need to check if the cell is diagonal by computing `tf.eye(batch_size) ==1`, or if the non-diagonal cell is greater than the diagonal with `(negative_zero_on_duplicate > tf.expand_dims(positive, 1)`. Remember that `positive` already has the diagonal values. Now you can use `tf.math.reduce_max`, row by row (axis=1), to select the maximum which is `closest_negative`.
# 
# Next, we'll create *mean_negative*. As the name suggests, this is the mean of all the 'negative'/blue values in `score` on a row by row basis. You can use `tf.linalg.diag` to create a diagonal matrix, where the diagonal matches `positive`, and just subtract it from `score` to get just the 'negative' values. This is `negative_zero_on_duplicate` in the code. Compute the mean by using `tf.math.reduce_sum` on `negative_zero_on_duplicate` for `axis=1` and divide it by `(batch_size - 1)`. This is `mean_negative`.
# 
# Now, you can compute loss using the two equations above and `tf.maximum`. This will form `triplet_loss1` and `triplet_loss2`. 
# 
# `triplet_loss` is the `tf.math.reduce_sum` of the sum of the two individual losses.

# 
# ### 3.1 Training the model
# 
# You will now write a function that takes in your model to train it. To train your model you have to decide how many times you want to iterate over the entire data set; each iteration is defined as an `epoch`. For each epoch, you have to go over all the data, using your `Dataset` iterator.

# - Compile the model. Here you will need to pass in:
#     - `loss=TripletLoss`

# - Call the `fit` method. You should pass:
#     - `train_dataset`
#     - `epochs`
#     - `validation_data` 
#

# 
# ### 4.1 Evaluating your siamese network
# 
# In this section you will learn how to evaluate a Siamese network. You will start by loading a pretrained model, and then you will use it to predict. For the prediction you will need to take the output of your model and compute the cosine loss between each pair of questions.

# In[25]:

# <a name='4.2'></a>
# ### 4.2 Classify
# To determine the accuracy of the model, you will use the test set that was configured earlier. While in training you used only positive examples, the test data, `Q1_test`, `Q2_test` and `y_test`, is set up as pairs of questions, some of which are duplicates and some are not. 
# This routine will run all the test question pairs through the model, compute the cosine similarity of each pair, threshold it and compare the result to `y_test` - the correct response from the data set. The results are accumulated to produce an accuracy; the confusion matrix is also computed to have a better understanding of the errors.
# 
# 
# <a name='ex05'></a>
# ### Exercise 04
# 
# **Instructions**  
#  - Loop through the incoming data in batch_size chunks, you will again define a `tensorflow.data.Dataset` to do so. This time you don't need the labels, so you can just replace them by `None`,
#  - split the model output pred into v1 and v2. Note that v1 is the first part of the pred while v2 is the second part of pred (see how the split was accomplished in TripletLoss function above),
#  - for each element of the batch
#         - Find the cosine similarity between `v1` and `v2`: Multiply `v1` and `v2` element-wise and use `tf.math.reduce_sum` on the result. This operation is the same as vector dot product and the resulting value is cosine similarity since `v1` and `v2` are normalized (by your model's last layer),
#         - determine if `d > threshold`,
#         - increment accuracy if that result matches the expected results (`y_test[j]`).
#   
#    Instead of running a for loop, you will vectorize all these operations to make things more efficient,
#  - compute the final accuracy and confusion matrix and return. For the confusion matrix you can use the [`tf.math.confusion_matrix`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/confusion_matrix) function.

# ### On Siamese networks
# 
# Siamese networks are important and useful. Many times there are several questions that are already asked in quora, or other platforms and you can use Siamese networks to avoid question duplicates. 
#
